 Type-safe operations on elements of an NSOrderedSet.

 This category enables some type and behavior dependent operations on elements of an NSOrderedSet.
 It is possible to perform actions such as enumeration, finding indices, and performing selectors on member objects based on criteria such as they kind, their adoption of a protocol, or whether they respond to a selector.
