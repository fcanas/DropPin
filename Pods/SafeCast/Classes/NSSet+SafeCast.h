/**
 Type-safe operations on elements of an NSSet.
 
 This category enables some type and behavior dependent operations on elements of an NSSet.
 It is possible to perform actions such as enumeration and performing selectors on member objects based on criteria such as they kind, their adoption of a protocol, or whether they respond to a selector.

 Sends to each object in the set the message identified by a given selector, starting with the first object and continuing through the set to the last object if and only if the object responds to the given selector.
 
 This method raises an NSInvalidArgumentException if aSelector is NULL.
